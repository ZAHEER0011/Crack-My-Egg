# Tech Stack

   - HTML: For structuring the game interface.
   - CSS: To design the layout, style the elements, and ensure responsiveness.
   - JavaScript: For dynamic functionality like updating counters, handling click events, and managing the high score system.

# ðŸŒŸ Features

   - Click Counter:
        Every time the user clicks the egg, the counter increases by 1.
        The score is updated in real-time with smooth UI feedback.

   - EggCoins:
        For every 10 points (i.e., 10 clicks), the user earns 1 EggCoin, visible in the EggCoin counter.
        This adds a sense of achievement for the user.

   - High Score System:
        The game keeps track of the highest score achieved during the session.
        Clicking the Reset button resets the current score to 0, but the EggCoin count remains intact.
        If the current score is greater than the previous high score before resetting, the new score is recorded as the High Score.

   - Reset Button:
        Allows the user to start over without losing EggCoins.
        Resets the score while updating the high score if applicable.

# ðŸŽ® How to Play

   1. Click on the egg to increase your score.
   2. Every 10 points give you 1 EggCoin.
   3. Try to achieve the highest score possible!
   4. Reset the game whenever you want â€“ your EggCoins stay with you, but your current score will restart from 0.
   5. The game automatically updates your high score if you beat your previous best before resetting.
